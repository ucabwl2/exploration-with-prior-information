# Using NDT-MCL for localisation in NDT maps.

This tutorial will show how to use the Graph_localization package to for robust localisation in NDT maps. 

### Prerequisites
This tutorial requires that you've completed teh Graph_map tutorial to create a map. 

## Running the localisation node
Launch the following command to start the NDT-MCL node, the optional argument run_bag:=true will replay the bag file specified in the launch file.
```
roslaunch graph_localization 2d_mcl_oru_lab.launch run_bag:=true
```
The NDT Map will be loaded from the path "Graph_map/maps/ndt_map.MAP". 
The estimate is initialised using the ground truth pose estimate from the topic "/robot1/kmo_navserver/state". The pose estimate can later be reinitialised using the "2D Pose Estimate" button in the in Rviz frontpanel.
