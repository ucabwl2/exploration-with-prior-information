# Auto Complete Graph.

## Paper

The auto complete graph method is presented in [this article](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1702.05087).

## How to optimize. Short version.

First we fix a node a the graph

```
oacg->getGraph().setFirst();
```

Then the graph is prepare by selecting the nodes and doing the initial optimization

```
oacg->prepare();
```

And then the optimization take place

```
oacg->optimize();
```
