# Pb 

* If I use the normal optimization 40 times and then DCS then the solution of the ACG is not good. It does work if I send a 10 iteration in one shot

If I manually do 10 and then DCS it is still good. Something happens if I optimize normally for too long.

Need to test :
* Does it happens consistently (test with new graphs)
* What conditions prompt this behavior


__Results__ :

It doesn't work for the 6 nodes

Need to test:
* Why ?

Also the inal result looks nice but some corner that should not be fused get fused this way. So it all depend on what is the end goal.
