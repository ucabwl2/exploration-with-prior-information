# Find the Qwt includes and library, either the version linked to Qt3 or the version linked to Qt4
#
# On Windows it makes these assumptions:
#    - the Qwt DLL is where the other DLLs for Qt are (QT_DIR\bin) or in the path
#    - the Qwt .h files are in QT_DIR\include\Qwt or in the path
#    - the Qwt .lib is where the other LIBs for Qt are (QT_DIR\lib) or in the path
#
# Qwt_INCLUDE_DIR - Where to find qwt.h if Qwt
# Qwt_VERSION     - The version of the library installed
# Qwt-Qt4_LIBRARY - The Qwt library linked against Qt4 (if it exists)
# Qwt-Qt3_LIBRARY - The Qwt library linked against Qt3 (if it exists)
# Qwt-Qt4_FOUND   - Qwt was found and uses Qt4
# Qwt-Qt3_FOUND   - Qwt was found and uses Qt3
# Qwt_FOUND - Set to TRUE if Qwt was found (linked either to Qt3 or Qt4)
