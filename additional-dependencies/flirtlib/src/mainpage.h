 * \mainpage FLIRTLib - Fast Laser Interest Region Transform Library
 *
 * \section what What's FLIRTLib?
 * FLIRTLib implements the Fast Laser Interest Region Transform introduced by Tipaldi and Arras. The library implements four different multi-scale 
 * feature detectors and two feature descriptors for 2D range data. It is written in C++ and comes with an API reference (written using Doxygen) and 
 * a set of example binaries to visualize the detector results and the descriptors, as well as perform scan to scan matching. 
 *
 * \subsection detectors Detectors
 * The library implements the following detectors: range, normal edge, normal blob and curvature. All detectors apply the scale-space theory (see \ref references)
 * to the range data. The first three detectors apply the theory to the monodimensional signal defined by the laser scanner, while the last one applies
 * the theory to the continuous geodesic coordinate of the curve that better approximate the point cloud. 
 * \li \e Range \e detector. It finds interest points in scale-space with a blob detector applied on the raw range information in the laser scan.
 * \li \e Normal \e Edge \e detector. It finds interest points in scale-space with an edge detector applied on a local approximation of the normal direction.
 * \li \e Normal \e Blob \e detector. It finds interest points in scale-space with a blob detector applied on a local approximation of the normal direction.
 * \li \e Curvature \e detector. It finds interest points using the scale space theory for curves introduced by Unnikrishnan and Hebert.
 *
 * \subsection descriptors Descriptors
 * \li \e Shape \e Context. It implements a local and linear version of teh Shape Context introduced by Belongie and Malik.
 * \li \e Beta-Grid. It implements a linear-polar occupancy grid. It extends the Shape Context with the notion of free space.
 *
 * \section down Download
 * The source code can be download from OpenSLAM (http://openslam.org/flirtlib.html)
 *
 * The archive has the following structure:
 * \li \c src/ : the source files
 * \li \c data/ : the log files used in the paper.
 * \li \c doc/ : the doxygen configuration file. Run doxygen in this directory and you will obtain a local copy of this html documentaion and the latex reference manual.
 *
 * The \c src/ directory has the following structure:
 * \li \c %mainpage.h : dummy header file for generating the documentation.
 * \li \c INSTALL : installation notes.
 * \li \c COPYING and COPYING.LESSER : the software license. See \ref license for further details.
 * \li \c CMakeLists.txt : the cmake configuration script.
 * \li \c build_tools/ : the directory containing the cmake modules.
 * \li \c feature/ : the directory with the main features code.
 * \li \c gemometry/ : the directory with the code for points.
 * \li \c gui/ : the directory with the code for teh gui and the flirtDemo.
 * \li \c sensors/ : the directory with the code for the sensors abstraction.
 * \li \c sensorstream/ : the directory with the code for the sensor streams abstraction.
 * \li \c utils/ : the directory with the code for utility function such as convolution, regression, pose estimation and histogram distances.
 * \li \c applications/ : the directory with the code for generating the binaries to test the library.
 *
 * \section inst Install
 * Download the library according to \ref down. The library relies on cmake to generate the Makefiles.
 * 
 * Create build directory \verbatim mkdir build && cd build \endverbatim
 * Run cmake and compile \verbatim cmake ../ && make \endverbatim
 * Generate the documentation (optional) \verbatim make doc \endverbatim
 * Install (dafault in /usr/local) \verbatim make install \endverbatim
 * 
 * The software depends on the following external libraries
 * \li <em> Boost >= 1.36 (submodules math and graph) </em>
 * \li <em> Qt4 (for the gui)</em> 
 * \li <em> Qwt5 for Qt4 (for the gui)</em> 
 * \li <em> OpenGL (for the gui)</em> 
 * \li <em> Cairo (for drwaing the ransac results)</em> 
 *
 * \section use Usage
 * The library comes with some demo binaries and an API interface.
 * \subsection software Binaries
 * The binaries are compiled out of the source and are available in <install_prefix>/bin. They consists in the following binaries
 * \li \c flirtDemo. It is a simple graphical frontend for visualizing the effect of the different detector and descriptors when changing the parameters.
 *                   To visualize the descriptors simply click on the corresponding interest points in the viewer.
 * \li \c ransacLoopClosureTest. It performs scan to scan matching with ransac. It generates a file with the number of succesful matches for the three different strategies. See the paper for more detail about the ransac experiment.
 * \li \c ransacLoopClosureDraw. It performs scan to scan matching with ransac. It generates a directory with images showing the matching results. It can used to generate animations.
 *
 * \subsection api Using the library
 * The library is compiled as a collection of shared objects and are available in \verbatim <install_prefix>/lib/ \endverbatim. 
 * The header files are located in <install_prefix>/include/flirtlib.  See the class list on the doxygen documentation for a more detailed API reference.
