/**
 * Representation of the RANSAC algorithm for feature matching.
 * The class represents the RANSAC algorithm for matching two different feature sets. 
 * The matching result is an Euclidean transformation (rotation + translation) encoded as a point in \f$ \mathcal{SO}(2) \f$.
 * The algorithm uses the Threshold strategy to obtain the possible correspondences from the features' descriptors. 
 * The main difference with the Nearest Neighobour is the increased complexity (reduced inlier probability) and the increased accuracy
 * especially in environment with very repetitive structures.
